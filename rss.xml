            <title><![CDATA[Interdisciplinary Teams]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Interdisciplinary Teams</h1><p>There were several good leaders that made up the panel we were part of at a large university today. The panel topic was interdisciplinary teams, and especially how they are used in applied settings. A couple of good tips were passed on to the next generation. This is a summary of some of the highlights. They may be basic, but the basics are often what gets overlooked - like when the tech support person asks "is it plugged in?"1. Show up. In other words, take the initiative to be where the work is and be completely present. Recognize that you, and everyone else on the team, have an agenda, so bring it. Be willing to work hard on things worth working toward, and you will be a leader.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/011b8ea66a46d560388523df3c63c67a5eb90167.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[Models of Leadership]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Models of Leadership</h1><p>If you've looked into material about leadership, you've undoubtedly found many different models. Often the models presented provide a convenient way to describe leadership - whether of an individual leader or within an organization. Sometimes they will even give suggestions of what type of leader or leadership style is preferred in certain environments. These days, most articles will include at least an acknowledgement that adaptability is needed. (for example, The Center for Association Leadership has an article online suggesting a "mix and match" approach  https://www.asaecenter.org/Resources/ANowDetail.cfm?ItemNumber=241962 )</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Innovation requires creativity</h1><p>The act of a prankster? Sure. A future leader? Depends on how it was handled.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Leadership philosophy</h1><p>There are a variety of leadership styles out there. Some work well in many situations. Some only work well in certain situations. Like good technology, the best leadership is invisible. No one realizes it's there because it's working so well. They think they are doing it themselves, and they mostly are.</p></article>]]></description>
