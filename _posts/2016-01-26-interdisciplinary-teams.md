There were several good leaders that made up the panel we were part of at a large university today. The panel topic was interdisciplinary teams, and especially how they are used in applied settings. A couple of good tips were passed on to the next generation. This is a summary of some of the highlights. They may be basic, but the basics are often what gets overlooked - like when the tech support person asks "is it plugged in?"  
1\. Show up. In other words, take the initiative to be where the work is and be completely present. Recognize that you, and everyone else on the team, have an agenda, so bring it. Be willing to work hard on things worth working toward, and you will be a leader.

2\. Ask questions. Rather than make assumptions about solutions, or even problem definitions, find out what the various perspectives on the team are. Interdisciplinary teams are excellent at uncovering aspects that no one has thought of before. This is why they can be such a rich source of truly innovative solutions.

3\. Listen - really listen. Take the time to get to know the other team members. Everyone brings more to the table than just their current job title or position.

4\. Be sure everyone is participating. Often the ones not speaking have some insights that are quite valuable. Sometimes they may be reluctant to express something simply because they don't realize they aren't the only one with that idea or concern. Other times they may simply assume everyone else knows 'it' already.

5\. Don't panic. Recognize that some conflict can be helpful. Not every problem will be solved in one meeting. Actually, not every problem will be solved, period. Some things must be resolved, some can stand as they are. By keeping focused on the end goal and patiently working to find ways to get even a step closer, big solutions are possible.

There was more, of course, but those were some of the most salient points.
