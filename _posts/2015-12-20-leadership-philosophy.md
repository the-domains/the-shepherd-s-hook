There are a variety of leadership styles out there. Some work well in many situations. Some only work well in certain situations. Like good technology, the best leadership is invisible. No one realizes it's there because it's working so well. They think they are doing it themselves, and they mostly are.

The leader guides around hazards so gently that no one panics. True leadership directs others to the resources rather than providing resources in a way that perpetuates dependency. Leaders that care about the followers give away their network connections and quickly give praise and credit to their co-workers (followers).

To truly lead is to make others great.
